Aidan O'Hara (ato22@pitt.edu) and Dylan Sparkenbaugh (djs231@pitt.edu)


We are looking for the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to speed in. We used the following datasets and information to try and find what neighborhood is the "best".

Datasets used:

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/311-data
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-traffic-signs
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps


Here Dylan and Aidan try to figure out what neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best to speed in. If you like to commit traffic violations, this is the repository for you! We hope you enjoy!
